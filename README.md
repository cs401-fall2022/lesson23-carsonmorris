This is an example website that uses express, liquid templates, and sqlite3.

**NOTE:** I tried my hand at sanitizing, so (unless I left something out), if you try to drop the table or delete data by typing into the text boxes, it won't allow it and will instead add "Nuh uh uh!" to the table and print "Not on my watch buddy!" to the console.

```bash
npm install
DEBUG=myapp:* npm start
```
